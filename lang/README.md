SupportBot Language Compatibility

In order to switch languages simple remove the current existig configuration file and replace it with one of the files here renamnig the file to "supportbot-config.yml" from (for example) "supportbot-config_es.yml" to home directory of SupportBot.

-> Delete the existing supportbot-config.yml file
-> Download the new file for whatever language
-> Upload the file to SupportBot and rename it to supportbot-config.yml
-> Job Done, restart the bot :wink:
